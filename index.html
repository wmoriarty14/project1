    Born and raised in Sales New Jersey. Growing up I had a typical childhood… played sports, bike rides, and playing man-hunt in the woods with some friends. YUP! Just your typical “Farm Boy” . As I started to grow into the man I am today. I found out I’m a full on homosexual. This was the biggest life change ever! Being a “homo” it opened me up to a whole new world. Like the feeling Ariel had when she just stepped on land for the first time. Since coming out I’ve kind of made my own family with the people that I surround myself with. Not saying my parents or sibling aren’t supportive we just now live different life styles that its sometimes hard to communicate because they live in their own little bubble and are ignorant to whatever is outside of that bubble… but anyways back my self made Family. The community with the people I surround myself with are so supportive and will do anything to make anyone happy. So the people I know surround myself are my life-line they encourage me, lift my spirit, make me laugh, and I couldn’t thank them enough..

    Anyways, enough about my past and current story here are a couple things I enjoy in my life. As a kid since I lived on a farm I loved to ride my horse even though its not something I do often now that I live in the city its still something that I enjoy. I’m also apart of a charity sports league called Stonewall Philly. It’s a LGBT and allies league I’ve participated in Dodgeball, kickball, yoga, and bowling. Its something that I van give back to the community that I love and as a part of charity to help the LGBT youth. I get the best of both worlds I get to give back and I get to still stay fit. Now I’m not saying I’m like the most athletic person out there but I do enjoy playing some sports… I tend to be very competitive.

    So what else is current in my life and whats up next? I’m currently taking a Web Development course its something that is tough and difficult but I’m sure once I get in my groove it will be so rewarding. I’ve always wanted a career in the tech industry. Its not going anywhere. In the future I tend get a secure career, buy a condo, and get a dog. Frenchie preferred. Of course last thing is I want to get well traveled.
